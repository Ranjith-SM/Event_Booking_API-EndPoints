## Challenges:
   ⏩ Atfirst When Creating API in backend , I faced struggle to create Model for the sqlSchema.

   ⏩ then for the backend i have linked two tables with a forein key and while receiving input i have save separately in a specific order, i find it difficult to understand at first. As the project moves i grasped a thing , how it works.

   ⏩ then in the process of creating UI for the project , choosing different colors or template is the first thing and all other basic utilities. 

   ⏩ then integrating the frontend to the Backend is hectic for me atfirst because each error will be taking atleast half a day to rectify.

   ⏩ then adding charts in the admin side , some methods to add a chart is not working in the angular V16. 
## Hardest Error:
      1. Saving Inputs of event and location details of the event in SQL. 
      2. file/image upload.
      3. value based form iteration and getting inputs from the form.
